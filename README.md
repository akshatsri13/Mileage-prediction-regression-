One useful example of applying regression techniques to real-world issues is the "Mileage Prediction - Regression Analysis" project. This study intends to provide insights that can aid in making educated decisions about vehicle efficiency by analysing the relationship between vehicle attributes and mileage. This might be especially helpful for manufacturers trying to build automobiles with higher mileage or for consumers wishing to buy fuel-efficient cars.

This research illustrates the useful uses of regression analysis in predictive modelling by encompassing the full machine learning workflow, from data collection and preprocessing to model creation and evaluation.
